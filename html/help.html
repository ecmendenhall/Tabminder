                        <h3>How to use Tabminder</h3>
                        <p>Tabminder is a simple Chrome extension designed to make you more mindful while browsing distracting sites. 
                        It prevents quick visits to Reddit, Twitter, and Hacker News from turning into work-sucking time vortexes by
                        providing a gentle reminder every few minutes. When you open a distracting tab, Tabminder starts counting down
                        from a preset time limit. When time's up, it will prompt you to close the tab or restart the timer. This is just 
                        annoying enough to intercept distracted browsing, but not so strict that it prevents you from taking a break once
                        in a while. (You deserve it, right?)</p>
                        <p>Once you've installed Tabminder in Chrome, you'll see a stopwatch icon in the toolbar:</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen1.png">
                        <p>To add your favorite time-wasting sites, click on the "options" link from your 
                        <a href="chrome://chrome/extensions/">extension settings</a> page:</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen2.png">
                        <p>Or click on the Tabminder icon in the toolbar and select "settings:"</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen3.png">
                        <p>Add a few distracting sites to your list of timesinks and a time in minutes for each one:</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen4.png">
                        <p>Make sure you enter each site's hostname exactly as it appears in the address bar.
                        <strong>Note:</strong> you might need to double-check your URLs. You don't need to enter 'http://' before the hostname, 
                        but you do need to include 'www' if it appears in the Chrome address bar (e.g. entering 'reddit.com' won't work, while entering
                        'www.reddit.com' will). If the timer doesn't start when you expect it, double-check your URLs. I'm working on better filtering in 
                        future updates.</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen5.png">
                        <p>When you visit a distracting site, the toolbar icon will turn red:</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen6.png">
                        <p>If you check "Show remaining time in toolbar" in the options page, the icon will also display the number of minutes remaining:</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen7.png">
                        <p>While you're browsing, you can add a site to the list of timesinks by clicking the toolbar icon and selecting "Add page to timesinks." 
                        Or, if you've found yourself on a distracting site, but don't want to add it permanently, you can start a temporary timer by selecting 
                        "Start timer."</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen8.png">
                        <p>Both these options use the default time limit from the settings page:</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen9.png">
                        <p>If you've been browsing a distracting site for too long, Tabminder will redirect you to a reminder page:</p>
                        <img src="/img/screen10.png">
                        <p>If you realize you're wasting time, click "close tab" and get back to work. If you're reading something really interesting, 
                        click "restart timer" and the countdown will start over again.</p>
