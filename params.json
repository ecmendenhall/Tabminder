When you open a distracting tab, Tabminder starts counting down from a preset time limit. When time's up, it will prompt you to close the tab or restart the timer. This is just annoying enough to intercept distracted browsing, but not so strict that it prevents you from taking a break once in a while. (You deserve it, right?)\r\n\r\n#Get Tabminder\r\nTabminder is available in the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/haffdbbhnmojclpkpmjhpdflflienkmk). If you're smarter than me and want to tinker with the source (you probably are), you can download Tabminder as an unpackaged extension by forking or cloning the [project repository](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/Tabminder) or clicking the icons on the left.\r\n\r\n#How to use Tabminder\r\nTabminder is my first Chrome extension, so there will be bugs. If you're lucky enough to find one, please \r\n[report it](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/Tabminder/issues) and I'll try to fix it. \r\n\r\n Once you've added it to Chrome, you'll see a stopwatch icon in the toolbar:\r\n\r\n![Toolbar icon](http://i.imgur.com/gghfW.png)\r\n\r\nVisit your [extension settings](chrome://settings/extensions) and open the options page:\r\n\r\n![Options](http://i.imgur.com/3uImm.png)\r\n\r\nor click on the toolbar icon and select 'Settings':\r\n\r\n![Toolbar settings](http://i.imgur.com/KmWCy.png)\r\n\r\nAdd a few distracting sites to the list of timesinks and a time limit in minutes for each.  \r\n\r\n![Timesink sites](http://i.imgur.com/1Cap1.png)\r\n\r\nMake sure you enter each site's hostname as it appears in the address bar.<br>\r\n**Note:** you might need to double-check your URLs. You don't need to enter 'http://' before the hostname, but you do need to include 'www' if it appears in the Chrome address bar (e.g. entering '[reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com)' won't work, while entering 'www.reddit.com' will). If the timer doesn't start when you expect it to, double-check your hostnames. I'm working on better filtering in future updates.\r\n\r\n![Timesink sites list](http://i.imgur.com/TtzuE.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you visit a distracting site, the icon will turn red:\r\n\r\n![Red toolbar icon](http://i.imgur.com/TWWBi.png)\r\n\r\nIf you check \"Show remaining time in toolbar\" in the options page, the icon will also display the number of minutes remaining:\r\n\r\n![Time in toolbar](http://i.imgur.com/zaxGc.png)\r\n\r\nWhile you're browsing, you can add a site to the list of timesinks by clicking the toolbar icon and selecting \"Add page to timesinks.\" Or, if you've found yourself on a distracting site, but don't want to add it permanently, you can start a temporary timer by selecting \"Start timer.\"\r\n\r\n![Start timer](http://i.imgur.com/KqCjn.png)\r\n\r\nBoth these options use the default time limit from the settings page:\r\n\r\n![Default time](http://i.imgur.com/AaKXp.png)\r\n\r\nIf you've been browsing a distracting site for too long, Tabminder will redirect you to a reminder page:\r\n\r\n![Reminder page](http://i.imgur.com/BT4D5.png)\r\n\r\nIf you realize you're wasting time, click \"close tab\" and get back to work. If you're reading something really interesting, click \"restart timer\" and the countdown will start over again.\r\n\r\n#License\r\nThis code is released under an MIT license.
